# F1-report

This is the pet-project from my course. My task was created report of qualification F1 and sorted by time of laps.

I used os lib for provided relative path to files.
For define time of lap I needed to open files, saved information, and made operation with datetime lib for converting data and calculate time of laps.
For creating app I used Flask, HTML, CSS.
